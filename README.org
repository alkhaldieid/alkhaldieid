** Auto Report Automation Tool
   As Deputy Site Manager, I was tasked with creating daily progress reports for governmental agencies, which were image-heavy and time-consuming using MS Word. To solve this, I automated the entire process using **LaTeX** and **Python**. With encouragement from my colleague **Ali Alzahrani**, I developed a tool that generates a PDF report in under 5 seconds, reducing the task from an hour of manual work to a few seconds.
   - The tool is now available for free on GitHub: [[https://github.com/alkhaldieid/auto_report][Auto Report Automation Tool]]
